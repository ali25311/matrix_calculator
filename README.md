# matrix_calculator

A small web application created with HTML, CSS, and JS that is a fully
functional Matrix calculator capable of performing basic matrix operations such as matrix
addition, matrix subtraction, matrix inversion and matrix multiplication.

This project was created alongside two friends of mine: Arnold Gozum and Stephen Landaas. My primary job was to develop and create the general design of the website using HTML5 and CSS3 in order to make sure everything is dispalayed properly in a simple, easy to follow manner.
